# Detecting Regional Seismic Waves Using Convolutional Neural Network

![Detecting Regional Seismic Phases](https://docs.ecognition.com/Resources/Images/ECogUsr/UG_CNN_scheme.png)

## Objective: 
- It is  a primary work to detect regional seismic phases to be used later in Seismic Tomography, Physical Strucure, and Seismic Analysis.   
- In this code I applied convolutional neural network on labeled spectral and temporal seismic records.

## Result:
- It was promissing and suggested the need to more seismic data to imporve the F1 score.
